        <p>JTAC/FAC(A)s will use a standardized briefing to pass information rapidly. The CAS brief, also known as the <em>9-Line Brief</em>, is the standard for use with fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft. The CAS briefing form helps aircrews in determining whether they have the information required to perform the mission. The brief is used for all threat conditions and does not dictate the CAS aircraft’s tactics. The attack brief follows the numbered sequence (1-9) of the CAS briefing form.</p>
        <h2>Briefing Elements</h2>
        <h3>Line 1 - IP or BP</h3>
        <p>The IP is the starting point for the run-in to the target. For rotary-wing aircraft, the BP is where attacks on the target are commenced. Items for Line 1 are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IP or BP by name</li>
            <li>Hasty BP</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Line 2 - Heading and Offset</h3>
        <p>The heading is given in degrees magnetic from the IP to the target or from the center of the BP to the target. JTAC/FAC(A)s give an offset (left/right) if a restriction exists. The offset is the side of the IP-to-target line on which aircrews can maneuver for the attack.</p>
        <h3>Line 3 - Distance</h3>
        <p>The distance is given from the IP/BP to the target. For fixed wing aircraft, the distance is given in nautical miles and should be accurate to a tenth of a nautical mile. For attack helicopters, the distance is given in meters from the center of the BP and is accurate to the nearest 100 meters.</p>
        <h3>Line 4 - Target Elevation</h3>
        <p>The target elevation is given in feet MSL. Target elevation is needed for cueing sensors and for weapon/targeting solutions for CAS platforms which require it.</p>
        <h3>Line 5 - Target Description</h3>
        <p>The target description should be specific enough for the aircrew to recognize the target. The target should be described accurately and concisely using plain language. If target sorts are required, they should be given later as part of amplifying information so as not to disrupt the flow of the CAS brief.</p>
        <h3>Line 6 - Target Location</h3>
        <p>The JTAC/FAC(A) provides the target location in 3 specific manners:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Grid Coordinates</em>. If using grid coordinates, JTACs/FAC(A)s shall include the 100,000 square meter identification.</li>
            <li><em>Latitude and Longitude</em>. Care should be taken to clearly communicate which specific format is being used as transposition errors or misinterpretation can result in significant coordinate error and greatly increase the risk of potential collateral damage.</li>
            <li><em>Offset from a Known Point</em>. Direction and distance from a geographical, man-made feature, navigational aid, or mark.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Line 7 - Mark Type / Terminal Guidance</h3>
        <p>The JTAC/FAC(A) will state the type of mark to be used (for example, smoke, laser, or IR). If using a laser designator, the JTAC/FAC(A) will also pass the code that will be used.</p>
        <p>When conducting an attack using off board lasing for LGWs, the JTAC/FAC(A) will pass call sign of the platform or individual that will provide terminal guidance for the weapon, the word “laser,” and laser code.</p>
        <h3>Line 8 - Friendlies</h3>
        <p>Cardinal/sub-cardinal heading from the target (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, or NW) and distance of closest friendly position from the target in meters (e.g., “South 300”).</p>
        <h3>Line 9 - Egress</h3>
        <p>These are the instructions the aircrews use to exit the target area. Egress instructions can be given as a cardinal direction by using control points or, if the operational environment allows, by stating <em>“Egress at pilot’s discretion.”</em> The word <em>“egress”</em> will be used before delivering the egress instructions. Consideration should be given to providing egress altitude in actual numbers, vice <em>“in your block.”</em></p>
        <h3>Remarks / Restrictions</h3>
        <p>The following is a list of remarks that may be included in the CAS brief. The order of the remarks portion of the CAS brief is recommended for a standard, logical flow of information. Only those elements that are applicable and have not previously been briefed should be included.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>LTL shall be passed if using ground-based laser designators (in degrees magnetic).</li>
            <li>Desired type/number of ordnance and/or weapons effects can be passed here when not passed in the game plan prior to the CAS brief.</li>
            <li>Surface-to-air threat.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Type of threat.</li>
                <li>Direction and distance from Line 6.</li>
                <li>Type suppression―continuous, interrupted, or non-standard. If non-standard, state the duration of the suppression relative to the CAS TOT.</li>
                <li>Suppression gun target line.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Additional fires. Gives aircrew SA to other explosions, fires, etc. on the battlefield.</li>
            <li>Additional radio calls as requested.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>IP inbound.</li>
                <li>In with heading or in with cardinal direction.</li>
                <li>Time to roll-in/release.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Additional remarks. The following information should be included if applicable:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Hazards to aviation.</li>
                <li>Weather.</li>
                <li>Additional target information including TLE CAT.</li>
                <li>Night vision capability.</li>
                <li>Other time considerations.</li>
                <li>Friendly mark (if any).</li>
                <li>Moving Target―time stamp with estimated speed and direction.</li>
                <li>Depending on the tactical situation or theater requirements, additional information such as ROE may need to be passed.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
