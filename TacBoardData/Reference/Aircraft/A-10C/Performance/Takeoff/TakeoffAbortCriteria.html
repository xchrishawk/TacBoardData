        <h2>Definitions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>50-Foot Obstacle Clearance Distance</b>: Horizontal distance from brake release to vertically clearing a 50-foot obstacle height.</li>
            <li><b>Acceleration Check Speed</b>: Minimum speed at end of acceleration check time or distance. Acceleration check speed should be less than refusal speed.</li>
            <li><b>Braked Deceleration</b>: Deceleration on runway aided by application of brakes.</li>
            <li><b>Continuation (Minimum Go) Speed</b>: Minimum speed from which takeoff speed can be attained in the remaining runway length with one engine at maximum thrust and one engine inoperative (windmilling).</li>
            <li><b>Critical Engine Failure Speed</b>: Speed to which the aircraft can be accelerated on both engines, experience an engine failure, and the continue the takeoff or stop in the same distance (computed critical field length).</li>
            <li><b>Critical Field Length</b>: Total distance required for the aircraft to accelerate on both engines to the critical engine failure speed, experience an engine failure, and then either continue the takeoff or stop.</li>
            <li><b>Refusal (Maximum Abort) Speed</b>: Maximum speed to which the aircraft can accelerate with dual-engine thrust, and then stop in the remaining runway length.</li>
            <li><b>Rotation Speed</b>: The airspeed at which the pilot initiates back (aft) stick pressure to achieve a rotation rate that will result in a takeoff attitude of 10° at the recommended takeoff speed (approximately 10 KIAS prior to takeoff speed).</li>
            <li><b>Runway Condition Reading (RCR)</b>: Number portion of a system reporting runway surface conditions (related to braking effectiveness).</li>
            <li><b>Runway Elevation</b>: Runway altitude above sea level (pressure altitude).</li>
            <li><b>Runway Slope</b>: Change in runway elevation, divided by runway length, multiplied by 100 (expressed in percent uphill or downhill).</li>
            <li><b>Single-Engine Acceleration</b>: Acceleration with one engine operating at maximum thrust and one engine inoperative (windmilling).</li>
            <li><b>Single-Engine Rate of Climb</b>: Rate of climb at takeoff speed, one engine at maximum thrust, one engine windmilling, flaps 7°, and landing gear down.</li>
            <li><b>Takeoff Ground Run</b>: Ground run in feet from brake release to takeoff speed.</li>
            <li><b>Takeoff Index</b>: A computed number that is a function of engine thrust, temperature, and pressure altitude. Used as a control parameter for most takeoff charts.</li>
            <li><b>Takeoff Speed</b>: The airspeed at which the main landing gear lifts from the runway.</li>
            <li><b>Wheel Brake Energy Limit Speed</b>: Highest speed from which the aircraft may be brought to a stop without exceeding the maximum design energy absorption capability of the brakes. Wheel brake energy limit speed is compared, in takeoff planning, with refusal speed.</li>
        </ul>
